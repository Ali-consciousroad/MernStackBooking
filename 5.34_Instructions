Instructions

- Now on login, token and user is sent from backend as response to frontend
- Save the token and user to redux state and also in the local storage
- Then each time you need to access some protected routes in backend
- ... which we'll be createing later (for posting a hotel for booking etc.)
- You will send this token in the req.headers 
- Then backend can check the token to see if it is valid with expiry and it match the JWT_SECRET 
- We can also use expressJwt middleware to extract user id from token 
which will be useful to get logged in user ???
